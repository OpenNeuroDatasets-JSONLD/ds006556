# A Comprehensive Dataset of Children with Tetralogy of Fallot Encompassing Brain MRI, Neurodevelopment, and Clinical Manifestations

This dataset comprises brain MRI and neurodevelopmental outcomes from children with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) enrolled in the CHD Neurodevelopment Outcome Study conducted at Children’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China. Data were collected between 2019 and 2023 from participants aged 4–33 months at enrollment. Each child underwent brain MRI and neurodevelopmental assessments, with follow-up using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence—Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV). The dataset aims to facilitate prediction and early identification of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, to enable replication of prior findings, and to provide an empirical basis for mapping the evolving structural and functional trajectories of the developing TOF brain. Additionally, it serves as a small-sample benchmark for AI algorithms in children with TOF, thereby promoting algorithm optimization and external validation.
